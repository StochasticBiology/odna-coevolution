# odna-coevolution
Coevolution of mtDNA and ptDNA genome content

Several substudies here. Phylogenetic information, gene counts, and gene contents are pulled variously from previous projects. Naive and corrected linear models, mixed models, phylogenetic linear models are used to explore mt-pt gene count correlations. Specific ecological features are also explored. At the gene-specific level, clustering, Oncotrees, and minimum-leaf arborescences are used to explore mt-pt coevolution.

The main code is `coevol-loop.R`, which loops through several different subsets of the complete dataset and works through the above analysis, producing and labelling plots as it goes.
