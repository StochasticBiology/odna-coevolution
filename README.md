Coevolution of mtDNA and ptDNA genome content

Several substudies here. Phylogenetic information, gene counts, and gene contents are pulled variously from previous projects. Naive and corrected linear models, mixed models, phylogenetic linear models are used to explore mt-pt gene count correlations. At the gene-specific level, clustering, Oncotrees, and minimum-leaf arborescences are used to explore mt-pt coevolution.
