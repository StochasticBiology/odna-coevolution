Coevolution of mtDNA and ptDNA genome content

Several substudies here. Phylogenetic information, gene counts, and gene contents are pulled variously from previous projects. Naive and corrected linear models, mixed models, phylogenetic linear models are used to explore mt-pt gene count correlations. Specific ecological features are also explored. At the gene-specific level, clustering, Oncotrees, and minimum-leaf arborescences are used to explore mt-pt coevolution.

To do:
* Truncate the gene dendrogram at an early stage and use that to assign gene tribes, like Kazeem's tribes of AMR genes -- _can do but need to think more thoughtfully_
* PLM plotting: assign a relatedness index to each datapoint based on e.g. number of partners within a given distance, or distance to 50% of the data, then use that as opacity in a scatter plot with PLM fit overlaid -- _somewhat done_
